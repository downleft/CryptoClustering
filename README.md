# CryptoClustering
Module 19 for Data Analytics Boot Camp

This challenge is set up to separate hypothetical cryptocurrency data into clusters using kmeans learning algorithms, and to see the impacts of looking at the same data when focusing on the three variables that have the greatest impact on determining clusters.

## Using the code
To run the code, clone the repo, and then run the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb file.  Charts and clusters will be created within the Jupyter Notebook file.
